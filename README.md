Call of Duty Bro-Larm
=====================
The Bro-Larm is a dog that barks when your friends log in to Call of Duty. The web app loads the user's Xbox friends from the [XboxLeaders](http://www.xboxleaders.com/) API for Xbox LIVE. It uses [Firebase](http://www.firebase.com/) for the Facebook authentication, and to store the user's Xbox LIVE gamertag and friend selections. Model data is automatically synced using [Backfire](https://github.com/firebase/backfire), the [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) binding for [Firebase](http://www.firebase.com/).
